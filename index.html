            <h1>Discover the Unforgettable Charms of a Modern Masterpiece</h1>
              <p> 
                Rotterdam is a young, dynamic city known for its modern architecture and impressive harbour. Although only a
                fraction smaller than Amsterdam, it has a completely different look and feel than the capital. The city is
                characterised by an imposing skyline of skyscrapers and modern design, but also by icons such as the Erasmus
                Bridge, Rotterdam Central Station and of course the Euromast observation tower, which offers breathtaking
                views of the city and surrounding areas.</p>
